                As part of measures to address the perennial challenges of theft or missing Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board(JAMB) has concluded arrangements to partner with the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) to issue UTME candidates with customised phone SIMS for UTME registration.
                The Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, explained this during the visit of a delegation of the West Africa Civil Societies Forum (WACSOF) to his office on Thursday, 27th June, 2024, in Abuja.
                According to the Registrar, the customised SIMs would only be used for UTME registration and would be accessible to only the parents with an expiry date of five years. He expressed confidence that the new SIM regime would solve the avalanche of problems associated with candidates' registration. He assured the coalition of civil society groups o the commitment of the Board to making its UTME registration not only seamless but also more flexible and user-friendly.
                In addition, the Registrar expressed the determination of the Board to continually come up with ways of leveraging on state-of-the-art technology to render efficient service delivery to Nigerians.
