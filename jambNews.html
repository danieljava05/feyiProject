            Candidates who sat the 2024 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) can now print their original result slips. These slips, which feature the candidate's photograph and advanced security features, can be printed from approved Computer-Based Test (CBT) centres starting from Monday, July 22, 2024. Please note that result slips cannot be printed from cybercafes or other internet-enabled platforms.
            Candidates are strongly advised to follow approved channels for printing and avoid falling victim to fraudulent activities, such as attempted score inflation, perpetrated by individuals seeking to exploit this process.
            It is important to note that candidates' scores were previously released via the Board's sort codes, so this physical copy serves as a secure and verifiable record of their results.

            JAMB has pegged 140 as a cut-off mark for admission into universities. The board also fixed 100 as the minimum cut-off point mark for admission into polytechnics and colleges of education. JAMB Registrar, Professor Ishaq Oloyede announced this on Thursday in Abuja at the 2024 JAMB Policy meeting.
            The meeting had in attendance the Minister of Education, Tahir Mamman, vice-chancellors, rectors and registrars of higher institutions and other stakeholders.
            The board also pegged the amount for Post-UTME screening at N2,000. According to JAMB, any institution interested in conducting any form of screening could do so, but the charge for the screening should not exceed N2,000 only.
            With the announcement of the cut-off marks, Public tertiary institutions will begin announcing their Post-UTME sales forms and screening dates. Candidates are to be on the look out for such announcements.

            The Federal Government through the Minister of Education has directed that admission to tertiary institutions should not be given to candidates under 18 years old as from next year.
            The Minister of Education initially stated that this new policy has to effect this year. However, this attracted mixed reactions and after much deliberations, it was decided that this new policy should take effect next year instead of this year since most candidates that registered for JAMB this year are below 18 and were not aware of this new development at the point of registration.
            According to the minister, the 18-year benchmark is in line with the 6-3-3-4 system of education.

            Professor Mamman added that for those who will not be able to gain admission into tertiary institutions, the Ministry of Education is taking skills to pupils from primary school.
